# ðŸŸ¢ Node.js Interview Questions & Answers (4+ Years Experience)

---

## What is Backend?

The backend ensures the application's scalability, performance, and security. It acts as the backbone of any web application, supporting user interactions and providing dynamic content.

---

## What is Node.js?

* Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment used to execute JavaScript code on the server side.
* Built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

---

## Difference between Node.js and JavaScript?

* **JavaScript**: A programming language that primarily runs in browsers for frontend development.
* **Node.js**: A runtime environment that enables JavaScript to run on the server.

---

## Key Features of Node.js

* Use JavaScript for both frontend and backend.
* Asynchronous and non-blocking I/O.
* Built on Chrome's V8 engine with JIT for fast execution.
* Rich ecosystem via npm with over a million packages.
* Supports microservices architecture.
* Cross-platform support: Windows, macOS, Linux.
* Large and active community.

---

## Why is MongoDB popular compared to other databases?

* NoSQL database that supports horizontal scaling.
* Stores unstructured data in flexible JSON-like documents.

---

## Difference between `require` and `import`

* **require**:

  * CommonJS syntax.
  * Synchronous loading.
  * Node.js specific.
  * Can be used conditionally.

* **import/export**:

  * ES6 standard.
  * Asynchronous loading.
  * Works in both Node.js and browsers.
  * Modules are loaded at the top of the file.

---

## Structured vs Unstructured Data

* **Structured**:

  * Predefined schema.
  * Uses rows and columns.
  * Supports relationships.

* **Unstructured**:

  * No predefined schema.
  * JSON, text, images, videos.

---

## Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling

* **Vertical**: Increase CPU/RAM on a single machine.
* **Horizontal**: Add multiple machines or instances.

---

## What is an API?

An API (Application Programming Interface) allows applications to communicate using a set of rules and protocols.

---

## Why are REST APIs commonly used?

* Simple HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
* Stateless architecture.
* JSON data format.
* Platform agnostic.
* Easy to scale.

---

## What is an API Endpoint?

* **Base URL**: Root address.
* **Resource Path**: /users, /orders/123
* **HTTP Methods**: GET, POST, etc.
* **Parameters**: Query (?page=1), Path (/user/\:id)

---

## What is GraphQL?

* Uses a single endpoint.
* Clients request specific fields.
* Ideal for nested/related data.

---

## What is npm in Node.js?

* Node Package Manager.
* Used to install/manage/share code packages.

---

## Asynchronous and Event-Driven

* Handles multiple requests without blocking.
* Uses event loop.

---

## Modules in Node.js

* **Core**: Built-in (fs, http).
* **Custom**: User-defined.
* **Third-party**: From npm.

---

## What is the Event Loop?

* Core mechanism for handling async operations.
* Phases: Timers, Pending Callbacks, I/O Polling, Check, Close Callbacks.

---

## What are Streams?

* Process data in chunks.
* **Readable**
* **Writable**
* **Duplex**
* **Transform**

---

## What is a Buffer?

* Handles binary data in memory.
* Used in file and TCP operations.

---

## What is Callback Hell?

* Nested callbacks leading to unreadable code.
* Solved with Promises or async/await.

---

## Error Handling

* **try-catch**: For sync.
* **.catch()**: For Promises.
* **async/await**: Use try-catch.
* Middleware in Express.

---

## Middleware in Express

* Functions to modify req/res.

**Types**:

* Application-level
* Router-level
* Error-handling
* Built-in (express.json)
* Third-party (cors, morgan)

---

## File System (fs) Module

* For file operations like reading/writing.

---

## Networking in Node.js

* Use `http` and `https` modules to build servers.

---

## How does Node.js handle concurrency?

* Single-threaded event loop.
* Delegates I/O to OS kernel.

---

## Worker Threads in Node.js

* Used for CPU-intensive tasks.
* Prevents blocking the event loop.

---

## Difference between `fork()` and `spawn()`

* `fork()`: Runs a new Node.js instance.
* `spawn()`: Runs shell commands.

---

## Security Practices

* Validate/sanitize input.
* Use HTTPS.
* Avoid deprecated packages.
* Use env variables.
* Implement authentication.

---

## Handling Asynchronous Code

* Callbacks
* Promises
* async/await

---

## What are Promises?

* Handle async tasks with `.then()` and `.catch()`

---

## What is async/await?

* Syntactic sugar over Promises.
* `async` function always returns a Promise.
* `await` pauses execution until Promise resolves.

---

## What are Callbacks?

* Function passed as an argument to another function.
* Used in async operations.

---

## Difference between `fs.readFile` and `fs.readFileSync`

* `fs.readFile`:

  * Asynchronous.
  * Uses callback.
  * Non-blocking.

* `fs.readFileSync`:

  * Synchronous.
  * Blocking.

---

## Request vs Response

* **Request**: Sent from client with method, headers, data.
* **Response**: Sent from server with status, headers, body.

---

## Load Balancing in Node.js

* Distributes requests across multiple app servers.
* Helps scale apps and handle large traffic.

---

## Difference between `process.nextTick()`, `setImmediate()`, and `setTimeout()`

| Function             | Execution Timing                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `process.nextTick()` | Runs **before any I/O**, after current operation. |
| `setImmediate()`     | Runs on the **next event loop iteration**.        |
| `setTimeout(fn, 0)`  | Runs after a minimum delay of 0ms.                |

---

## Clustering in Node.js

* Use `cluster` module to create worker processes.
* Each worker runs on a different CPU core.
* Enhances concurrency in multi-core environments.

---

## Middleware Chaining in Express

```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Step 1');
  next();
});
```

---

## Synchronous vs Asynchronous Error Handling

* Sync: `try/catch`
* Async:

  * Callback: `if (err) {}`
  * Promise: `.catch()`
  * async/await: `try/catch`

---

## What is `util.promisify()`?

Converts a callback-based function to a promise-based one:

```js
const { promisify } = require('util');
const fs = require('fs');
const readFileAsync = promisify(fs.readFile);
```

---

## Performance Tuning Techniques

* Use clusters/worker threads.
* Implement caching.
* Avoid blocking code.
* Use `gzip` compression.
* Optimize DB queries.
* Use monitoring tools like PM2 or Clinic.js.
